# Java Todo Application
// image here

## Learning goals

# Usage
*Note that the program is written with Linux. Other operating systems were not tested.*

## Installing and Compiling
1) Clone the repository and its submodule by ``` git clone <project SSH/URL> ```
2) direct to the cloned folder ```cd <folder_name>```
3) ```javac TodoApp```

*Check the MiniLibX ReadMe in case of problems with the library.*

*NOTE:* by default the program compiles with the extras of cones, multiple light sources, colored light and phong effect. To disable the extras, set DBONUS in the path variable (```export DBONUS=0```). Additional debug values will be printed in the prompt after setting ```export DPARSER=1``` and ```export DRENDER=1``` (don't forget to re-compile!!!)

## Execution
``` java TodoApp ```
